Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Who are Sikh Gurus and why are they important?	"Sikh Gurus are spiritual teachers who share wisdom and guidance from God. The first Guru was Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism in the late 1400s. Nine subsequent Gurus built on Guru Nanak’s foundational revelations through the early 1700s, when Guru Gobind Singh completed the compilation of the Sikh holy book and declared this sacred text the final Guru—Guru Granth Sahib.

Why do so many Sikhs have the last name Singh or Kaur?	"The Sikh Gurus sought to abolish the Indian caste system that assigned value and rights to individuals based on the families they were born into. As part of the movement to end caste discrimination and promote equality among all humans, followers of Sikhism were encouraged to adopt common last names, leaving no identifiable differences between individuals from rich or poor backgrounds. Men were instructed to adopt the last name Singh, meaning lion, and women were encouraged to use Kaur, meaning princess. The use of Kaur, as opposed to adopting family names in marriage, promotes women as individuals with value and identities existing independently of their relationships with men."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Why don’t Sikhs cut their hair?	"Sikhs refrain from cutting or removing our hair out of a deep personal devotion to God. We believe that our bodies were made by God, and we must be willing to accept God’s gift without altering it. Sikhs take great care to keep our long hair clean and tidy using a comb called a kangha. The kangha is carried with Sikhs always and represents the importance of living with cleanliness and discipline."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Where do Sikhs worship?	"The Sikh version of a church, temple, mosque, or synagogue is a gurdwara. The gurdwara is a central gathering place for those in the Sikh community to pray, sing, learn, and connect. (visit your local gurdwara here)!

Do Sikhs believe in heaven and hell?	"Sikhs do not believe in heaven or hell as destinations—for Sikhs, heaven can be experienced by drawing near to God during life, while the suffering and pain caused by ego is considered hell on earth. In Sikhism, spiritual acts are positive experiences with affects felt on earth and after death, rather than sacrifices made in order to collect a reward that is waiting until after death. The main purpose of life, according to Sikhism, is to become one with the God. This is pursued by a life focused on remembering the Creator always, earning an honest living as a householder, and sharing one’s abundance with the less fortunate. In death, we believe we become one with God and the universe."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What is the definition of a Sikh?	"The most widely accepted definition of a Sikh comes from the Sikh code of conduct, the Rehat Maryada.

Why don’t people know about Sikhism even though it is the 5th largest world religion?	"There are several different reasons. First, Sikhism, compared to other world traditions, is relatively young. The faith first emerged in 1469. Second, since many people are not aware that Sikhism is the fifth largest world religion, it is not referenced when discussing the other world religions. For example, many school textbooks have incorrect or no information on the faith."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Is there an official sikh greeting?	"The tenth Sikh Guru instructed Sikhs to greet each other with “Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru ji ki Fateh” (“The Khalsa belongs to Waheguru (the Divine) and victory belongs to Waheguru”).

Is there a Sikh emblem or symbol? What is the historical significance of the khanda?	"The Ik Onkar and the Khanda are some of the symbols of the Sikhs. According to the Sikh scholar Kapur Singh, the Khanda first appeared around the eighteenth century.  \n\n“The Khanda is the symbol of the Sikhs, as the Cross is to Christians or the Star of David is to Jews. It reflects some of the fundamental concepts of Sikhism. The symbol derives its name from the double-edged sword (also called a Khanda) which appears at the center of the logo. This double-edged sword is a metaphor of divine knowledge, its sharp edges cleaving truth from falsehood. The circle around the Khanda is the chakar. The chakar being a circle without a beginning or end symbolizes the perfection of God who is eternal. The chakar is surrounded by two curved swords called kirpans. These two swords symbolize the twin concepts of meeri and peeri – temporal and spiritual authority introduced by Guru Hargobind. They emphasize the equal emphasis that a Sikh must place on spiritual aspirations as well as obligations to society.”"	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Is there a particular sikh color? Saffron?	"There is no particular color for Sikhs or Sikhism. The Sikh flag, which is seen at almost every Gurdwara, is a bright orange/saffron color or dark blue. These represent traditional colors for Sikhs."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
"Why do so many Sikhs have a common name, Singh or Kaur?"	"The tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, created the unique identity of the Sikhs and also gave all Sikh men one last name – Singh and all Sikh women another – Kaur. The reason for doing so is strongly rooted in the culture of South Asia. In that time period’s caste-ridden society and even today, someone’s last/family name signifies their social status and caste. Guru Gobind Singh wanted to remove these barriers between people, and create an egalitarian society. The word Singh means Lion and the word Kaur denotes Princess."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Do some Sikhs keep their last (caste) name? Why?	"Many Sikh families have kept their family name, but have maintained Singh and Kaur as middle names."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Do Sikhs have any dietary restrictions? Can Sikhs eat meat?	"Sikh Gurus strongly forbade all rituals and superstitions. Sikhs are thus not allowed to eat any food prepared through a ritualistic process (e.g., Sikhs are not meant to eat Kosher or Halal). There is no mandate allowing or disallowing Sikhs to eat meat. Sikhs are also not supposed to drink alcohol or consume any other intoxicants."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Is there a Sikh ceremony of initiation?	"Yes. Initiated Sikhs are said to have joined the “Khalsa.” Joining the Khalsa is an important step in one’s life.

Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
How old do you have to be to be initiated?	"There is no prescribed age at which a Sikh should be initiated and can choose to do so whenever he or she is ready.

It is important that once you are initiated you are committed to that lifestyle."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
why don’t Sikhs cut or shave their hair?	"The founders of the Sikh faith started the practice of keeping hair unshorn. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, gave the Sikhs 5 articles of faith (including unshorn hair), which as a whole comprise the daily uniform of a Sikh. In other words, keeping your hair (kesh) and wearing a turban form an external identity for a Sikh."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
How about people with cut hair who identify themselves as Sikh?	"All Sikhs are supposed to have uncut/untrimmed hair. But like in every religion, there are people who closely follow the religion and others who may not. Some people may cut their hair, but that does not exclude them from the Sikh community."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Do women shave?	"Sikhs are not supposed to cut hair from any part of their body. All Sikhs are thus supposed to have unshorn hair, and Sikh women are to maintain a separate identity and not shave."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]

How can I tell the difference between Sikh turbans and other turbans?	"Ever Sikh ties his or her turban slightly differently. Remember that in Pakistan, 70% of the people you see wearing a turban will be Sikh. If you see someone wearing a turban and you are not sure if they are Sikh or not, ask them! The Sikh turban is thus an article of faith. People of many other cultures and religions wear turbans, but none are required to do so by their religion.  \n\nSikhs tie their turbans anew each day. Sikh turbans become a part of a Sikh’s body and are usually removed only in the privacy of the house."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Do women wear turbans?	"Just like Sikh men, Sikh women are not supposed to cut their hair. In the Rehat Maryada, it is explicitly written that Sikh men wear a turban. There is nothing explicitly written about women, except that the turban is optional. Traditionally, women have always covered their head, but we’ve seen in the last 50 years, that women have deviated from this. There are many reasons for this change: globalization, cultural trends, and a lack of clarity in the Rehat Maryada. For Sikh women who tie a turban, the turban is just as much a part of their body and identity as it is for Sikh men!"	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Why do Sikhs wear a kirpan? What size kirpan does a Sikh carry?	A kirpan does not have a prescribed length. In most cases it is about 3-9 inches long.

Do you have to be a Sikh to read the Guru Granth Sahib?	Anyone who wishes to can read the Guru Granth Sahib.	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Do Sikhs have a Clergy? Do Sikhs have a Granthis or Gianis?	"No. Sikh gurus were very clear about each Sikh making her or his own journey and not depending on a clergy to show them the way. Sikhs do have Granthis or Gianis. These are people who have studied the Sikh scriptures extensively, and are available in the Gurdwaras as teachers. They often lead a congregation, but any members from the congregations – both men and women – can also perform the same ceremonies."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Can women execute duties in a gurdwara or congregation?	Women execute duties in a gurdwara. Sikhism does not delineate or define certain tasks to only men or only women. A woman can lead or take part in any service or ceremony just as a man would.	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Why are men and women divided into separate sections while sitting in the gurdwara?	"Sikh Gurus always taught equality between men and women. In Sikh congregations, men and women are asked to sit side by side – women on one side of the Guru Granth Sahib, and men on the other. There are both practical and cultural reasons for this practice. Since everyone sits on the floor, often unintentionally touching the person next to them when there is a large congregation, having such interaction with the member of the opposite gender is frequently inappropriate in the cultural context in which Sikhism arose. However, in some smaller Gurdwaras, men and women may be seen sitting mixed in the congregation."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What is langar?	"The Sikh Gurus instituted the unique practice of Langar. Langar is food that is cooked by the members of the community and served by members of the community, to all people at the Gurdwara.

What is the Sikh wedding ceremony? What is Anand Karaj? What should I know about Sikh wedding?	"The Sikh marriage ceremony is called Anand Karaj.

In a Sikh wedding, scripture is read from the Guru Granth Sahib, and after each section the couple walks around the Guru Granth Sahib, showing their commitment to the teachings being read. This is done four times. Following this, a communal prayer is said for the couple and religious hymns are sung. The ceremony may be performed by any initiated member of the Sikh faith. The prayers being read indicate that the couple pledge allegiance to each other as well as the Sikh way of life and make a commitment to working together to help each other realize the Divine Presence."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
"Do you believe in an afterlife? Do you believe in heaven or hell, salvation?"	"Sikh focus is on this lifetime. The Sikh Scripture ask Sikhs to make the best of their time on this earth, for this is one’s opportunity to accomplish her or his best and to make a connection with Waheguru – the One, Omnipotent Power. Sikhs are asked not to partake in rituals and superstitions and not to concentrate on what occurred before birth or after death. Sikh scripture repudiates a belief in a physical place called Heaven or Hell. Similarly, Sikhism rejects the notion of a Judgment Day. Sikhs believe in the doctrine of karma, which is a cosmic law that takes into account a person’s good and bad actions during his or her lifetime. The person then is rewarded or must endure suffering based on his deeds. The Sikh scripture supports the idea of reincarnation."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
How do Sikhs perform funerals?	"According to the Sikh Rehat, Sikhs may dispose the body of the dead in any way they like. Sikhs generally cremate their dead because it is clean, simple and environmentally friendly. The body is bathed and clothed in fresh clothes by family members, and community members say collective prayers. The ashes are usually gathered afterwards, and put afloat in a flowing body of water – returning the person’s last physical remains to nature."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What does Sikhism teach about other religions?	"The Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, is the only major religious text which contains writings by teachers of other faiths. This is because Sikh gurus taught that there are many different ways of achieving a connection with the God. The Sikh way is one of these ways. If you are following the Sikh way, you must follow it to the best of your abilities, and with absolute devotion."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Does Sikhism try to convert others?	"Sikhism forbids proselytization or forced conversions. Sikhism believes that there are many paths to achieving attunement with the Divine. However, Sikhism welcomes those interested in learning about the religion. Thus, people might learn about Sikh faith and then even be initiated as Sikhs. There are Chinese Sikhs, African Sikhs etc. However, once someone is initiated as a Sikh, she or he must follow the Sikh path to the best of her or his ability."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]

Unlike other faiths where only the clergy are in uniform, all Sikhs are enjoined to wear the uniform of their beliefs.

Do women wear turbans?	"Just like Sikh men, Sikh women are not supposed to cut their hair. They are also required to cover their heads. Many Sikh women do so with a scarf. Others tie a turban. For Sikh women who tie a turban, the turban is just as much a part of their body and identity as it is for Sikh men! Culturally, many Sikh women do not cover their heads, but this is like in every religion—cultures and trends influence how closely people follow religion."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
How is a Sikh turban different from an Arab turban?	"Sikhism is the only religion in the world which requires its followers to tie a turban. The Sikh turban is thus an article of faith. People of many other cultures and religions wear turbans, but none are required to do so by their religion. Arabs wear turbans, people in the Indian dessert state of Rajasthan wear turbans, Africans wear turbans—but none of these people are ‘required’ to wear their turbans.  \n\nSikh turbans may be of different colors, styles and types but are not hats. Sikhs tie their turbans anew each day. Asking a Sikh to take off his turban in say a fancy club or church is like asking a person to remove his pants. Sikh turbans become a part of a Sikh’s body and are usually removed only in the privacy of the house."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Do women shave?	"Sikhs are not supposed to cut hair from any part of their body. All Sikhs are thus supposed to have unshorn hair, and Sikh women are to maintain a separate identity and not shave. But, living in the present-day, many succumb to the societal pressure and do shave."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
How about people with cut hair who identify themselves as Sikh?	"All Sikhs are supposed to have uncut/untrimmed hair. But like in every religion, there are people who closely follow the religion and others who stray due to different pressures.  \n\nSome people may cut their hair, but that does not exclude them from the Sikh community. However, the Sikh religion very clearly dictates that we are not supposed to cut or shave our hair."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What are kirpans?	"The Kirpan is a religious sword that encapsulates an initiated Sikh’s solemn obligation of courage and self-defense. It denotes dignity and self-reliance, the capacity and readiness to always defend the weak and the oppressed.

All Initiated Sikhs are mandated to wear a Kirpan on their body at all times."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What is that bracelet?	"The bracelet is a “Kara,” and is generally made out of steel. The Kara is one of the mandatory Sikh articles of faith, meant to be worn by a Sikh at all times."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What is the comb?	"Sikhs carry a small comb, called the Kanga. It can be worn easily in the hair at all times and is a symbol of cleanliness.

What is the under shorts?	"A special, slightly longer type of shorts, the Kachha is linked to a high moral character and must be worn at all times. It reminds the Sikh of the need for self-restrain over passions and desires."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
"Why do so many Sikhs have a common name, Singh or Kaur?"	"The tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, created the unique identity of the Sikhs and also gave all Sikh men one last name – Singh – and all Sikh women another – Kaur. The reason for doing so is strongly rooted in the culture of South Asia. In that time period’s caste-ridden society and even today, someone’s last/family name signifies their social status and caste. Guru Gobind Singh wanted to remove these barriers between people, and create an egalitarian society. "	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What does Singh mean?	"The word “Singh” means “Lion” and the word “Kaur” denotes “Princess.” Over time, many Sikh families have reverted to using their family name, but have maintained Singh and Kaur as middle names."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Is Sikhism a blend of Islam and Hinduism or a sect of Hinduism?	"It is only due to a shared geographic culture that some ideas or methods of these different religions may seem similar. Sikhism is in fact a unique revealed religion. It is not derived from any other religion. It is not a blend of any two or three religions. Guru Nanak started a new faith.  \n\nThe uniqueness of the Sikh faith is immediately apparent if you understand the main philosophies and practices of the Sikhs. In fact, Sikhism questions, challenges and rejects many of the practices of Hinduism and Islam. For example, according to Sikh teachings, all people are created equal regardless of gender, status, geographic location, and religion affiliation. Sikhs strive to achieve a balance between spiritual life and temporal life.  \n\nSikhism condemns empty rituals. Sikhs do not believe in pilgrimages, idolatry or reverence to pictures. Sikhs believe in practices such as daily prayer that instill understanding and discipline."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What does Sikhism teach about other religions?	"The Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, is the only major religious text which contains writings by teachers of other faiths. This is because the Sikh Gurus taught that there are many different ways of achieving a connection with the God. The Sikh way is one of these ways. If you are following the Sikh way, you must follow it to the best of your abilities, and with absolute devotion."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Does Sikhism preach conversion?	"Sikhism forbids proselytization or forced conversions. Sikhism believes that there are many paths to God. That said, Sikhism welcomes anyone interested in learning about the religion. Thus, people might learn about Sikh faith and then even be baptized as Sikhs. There are Chinese Sikhs, African Sikhs etc. However, once someone is baptized and initiated as a Sikh, she or he must follow the Sikh path to the best of her or his ability."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
"Do Sikhs believe in an afterlife? Do they believe in heaven/hell, salvation?"	"Sikhs’ focus is on this lifetime. The Sikh Scripture ask Sikhs to make the best of their time on this earth, for this is one’s opportunity to accomplish her or his best and to make a connection with Waheguru—the One, Omnipotent Power. Sikhs are asked not to partake in rituals and superstitions and not to concentrate on what occurred before birth or after death. Sikh scripture repudiates a belief in a physical place called Heaven or Hell. Similarly, Sikhism rejects the notion of a Judgment Day."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What do Sikhs think about terrorism and events like 9/11?	"Sikhs are against terrorism. Instead, Sikhs are commanded to defend the innocent and fight against oppression. Of course, some Sikhs have committed crimes against innocent victims, but these people do so against the teachings of the religion.  \n\nRecent media images cause a bias against people with turbans and beards but in fact Sikhs support defending the innocent, not harming them."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What does Sikhism say about pre-marital sex?	"Sikhs are forbidden to have sexual relations with anyone other than their spouse. Sikh teachings urge people to control all desires, including the sexual. The union of matrimony is considered very sacred and important, and sex outside this union is decried."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Do Sikhs believe in birth control?	"The Sikh scriptures do not expressly say, “Thou shall not consume birth control pills”. However, Sikhism places a very high importance on family life and family planning."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Do Sikhs have a clergy?	"The Sikh gurus were very clear about each Sikh making her or his own journey and not depending on clergy to show them the way. Sikhs do, however, have Granthis. These are people who have studied the Sikh scriptures extensively and are available in the Gurdwaras as teachers. They often lead a congregation, but members from the congregations – both men and women – can always perform the same ceremonies."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
What is the bowing? What is matha teknaa?	"In every Gurdwara (Sikh place of congregation and worship), the Sikhs scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, is placed at the back of the room, and everyone who enters the room, bows in front of it and touches their forehead to the ground. This is a symbol of surrendering yourself to the message of the scripture. Visitors don’t have to bow and can simply sit down with the congregation."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Why are men and women divided into separate sections while sitting in the gurdwara?	"The Sikh Gurus always taught equality between the sexes. For instance, the Gurus decried the cultural climate that denied women access to religion and gave women equal rights as men in all spheres. Still, in Sikh congregations, men and women are asked to sit side by side—women on one side of the Guru Granth Sahib, and men on the other. "	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Why do people sit down on the floor for langar?	"The Sikh Gurus instituted the unique Sikh practice of Langar to break down caste barriers. Langar is food that is cooked by the members of the community and served by members of the community, to all people at the Gurdwara. The idea is to demonstrate equality of all people, irrespective of caste, creed, religion, race or sex. All Gurdwaras have a common kitchen, where Langar is cooked by volunteers and open to all."	Gurdwara Knowledge Base.docx		[]
Can women execute duties in a gurdwara or congregation?	"Sikhism does not delineate/define certain tasks to only men or only women.
